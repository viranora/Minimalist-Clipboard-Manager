Clarity Clip - Minimalist Clipboard Manager

A sleek, simple, and visually appealing clipboard history manager built with Electron. This desktop widget runs quietly in the background, tracks your clipboard history, and makes it easy to retrieve previously copied items.

This project was built to explore Electron's native capabilities (like the clipboard API) and create a useful desktop utility that also looks beautiful, featuring animated gradients and a "glassmorphism" effect.

✨ Key Features

Clipboard History: Automatically saves the last 10 text items you've copied.

Click to Re-copy: Simply click any item in the list to instantly copy it back to your clipboard.

Animated UI: A vibrant, animated gradient background (lila/pink tones) makes the app visually engaging.

Glassmorphism List: History items use a semi-transparent, blurred background effect.

Instant Feedback: Get a "Copied!" notification when you re-copy an item.

Minimalist: Fixed-size (350x500) window designed to be a simple, focused utility.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Electron: For building the cross-platform desktop application.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): For all application logic (no frameworks).

CSS3: For all styling, including gradient animations, flexbox, and glassmorphism.

Node.js (Clipboard API): For interacting with the native system clipboard.

This is a personal project created for learning and demonstration purposes.
